# A little bit about me
I'm Ashish Basetty, a computer engineering student @ UCLA who enjoys working on interesting projects and exploring new technologies and tools. When I'm offline, I also enjoy going to concerts, trying new cuisines, and learning to dance to fun choreos.

# My Projects
An overview of a couple of my projects posted on my github. Feel free to take a look at some of my work so far!

## Sign Language Alphabet Translator
For fun over the summer, I taught myself OpenCV and how to build and train a YOLOv8 model through tutorials. I built a simple model that could translate sign langauge in real-time from a video, and trained it using data from my room. While it could be more accurate with hand pose detection or more advanced hardware than my PC's GPU, I am satisfied with the results and seems to work somewhat effectively given my dataset. Here is a link for a quick demo: https://youtu.be/4hZh6LRzbQw

## BruinConnect
In my class CS35L, I worked with a team to build a detailed event posting social app, using React.js, Material-UI, node.js, and MongoDB Atlas. I built out various features including secure login, maps and location search functionality, friends, likes, and a detailed suggestion algorithm that takes into a account filters and preferences.
I ended up learning a lot of interesting technologies, including server-client functionality, Google Maps API, and password hashing and encryption. Here is a link to our team's product demo, thanks for checking it out: https://youtu.be/NCozV5VEP_8?si=VrajDKqqB8teeBLV

## Musical Analysis
For my musical analysis project, I used data science and a set of around 60 songs to train a basic model to distinguish between rap, acoustic, and EDM music. It turned out to have a decent accuracy of around 75% for classifying new music from one of the three genres, and I also built a basic ML model to try and classify data. While the ML model didn't prove effective likely due to overfitting, it was a good experience in applying data science to a practical application. You can find the code under the repo _musical-analysis_

## Pomododo
With my hackathon team at LA Hacks, we built a site that allowed users to customize and use alternating study timers, with a social design and a simple backend. I applied google authentication and firebase document models to store user study hours and create unique user accounts, as well as work on various pages on the site. Here is a demo we made for the hackathon: https://youtu.be/CTDuFxCB_I0

## Lilypad
With another hackathon team, I built a basic website Lilypad to host listings for free food around campus. While we were not able to completely refine the site, I gained insight into applying vanilla React.js as well as connecting and using a Firebase backend.
