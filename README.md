Hey everyone,
I'm Ashish Basetty, a computer engineering student @ UCLA who enjoys working on interesting projects. Feel free to take a look at some of my work so far!

An overview of a couple of my projects posted on my github:

In my class CS35L, I worked with a team to build a detailed event posting social app, using React.js, Material-UI, node.js, and MongoDB. Features include secure login, maps and location search functionality, friends, likes, and a detailed suggestion algorithm that takes into a account filters and preferences.

For my musical analysis project, I used data science and a set of around 60 songs to train a basic model to distinguish between rap, acoustic, and EDM music. It turned out to have a decent accuracy of around 75% for classifying new music from one of the three genres, and I also built a basic ML model to try and classify data. While the ML model didn't prove effective likely due to overfitting, it was a good experience in applying data science to a practical application.

With my hackathon team, we built a site that allowed users to customize and use alternating study timers, with a social design and a simple backend. I applied google authentication and firebase document models to store user study hours and create unique user accounts, as well as work on various pages on the site.

With another hackathon team, I built a basic website Lilypad to host listings for free food around campus. While we were not able to completely refine the site, I gained insight into applying vanilla React.js as well as connecting and using a Firebase backend.
